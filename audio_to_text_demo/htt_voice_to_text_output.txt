Hi, James. I'm Maria. I'm gonna be your nurse today. 
I just need to do a set of vital signs and do a head to toe assessment if that's okay with you. 
Yes. Of course. Hi, Maria. 
Okay. Let me get started on the vital signs. How are you feeling today? I'm I'm okay. K. Alright. Let me just ask you a couple of questions. Could you please let me know what your full name is, where you are, what the date is, and why you're here? I'm James Martins. I am at Rocky View Hospital. I believe it's February 27, and I'm here because they're trying to figure out what's wrong with my lung with my lungs. Okay. Definitely. We're gonna look into that for you. I just wanna tell you what your vital signs are. So you're a little bit cool, 35.8. I'm also noticing that you're a little bit clammy as if you've been sweating. Your heart rate's a little fast at one thirty two. Are you feeling tachycardic or, like, your heart's racing? I do feel them a little bit. Okay. Alright. Your respirate is 22 beat or rests per minute. Your oxygen is 85% on room air, so I'm just gonna put some oxygen on you right now at two liters. I'm also noticing that your lips are a little bit blue. So this oxygen should help with that. K? Thanks. And your blood pressure's a little on the low side, a hundred over 65. It's lower than it's normally been for you. K? Now, I'm really interested in listening to your lungs. I wanna find out why your oxygen is dropping. Okay? Oh, boy. Okay. I'm noticing that you're you're getting some blood out when you cough. How long has that been going on for? I think it's been a couple of hours, and I'm feeling super short of breath even when I'm just laying in breath in bed. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me quickly listen to your heart and lungs. Okay? Your heart sounds irregular, and your lungs sound like there are crackles in both of them. Okay? Try to take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. I'm going to so I I can't breathe. Please help me. Okay, James. We're gonna get some help right now. We're gonna call the doctor. Try to relax. Okay? Thank you.
